# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 08, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how SpentSmart ("we", "us", or "our") handles your personal information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We are a privacy-first application.** We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal financial data on our servers. All your transaction data, notes, and categories are stored locally on your device.

### 1.1 Financial Data
Your transaction history and budget information are stored securely on your device using local storage technologies. We do not have access to this data.

### 1.2 Permissions
We request the following permissions to provide core functionality:

- **Camera**: Used solely for scanning UPI QR codes to facilitate payments. No images or videos are saved or transmitted to us.
- **Contacts**: Used to help you easily select payees for manual transactions. Your contact list is not uploaded to any server.
- **Biometrics (Fingerprint/FaceID)**: Used to secure access to the app. Biometric data remains on your device and is not accessible to us.

## 2. Third-Party Services
We may use third-party services for app stability and updates (e.g., Expo). These services may collect anonymous usage data to help us improve the app stability.

## 3. Data Retention
Since we do not store your data on our servers, you have full control over your data retention. Uninstalling the app effectively deletes all your transaction history from the device, unless you have created a manual backup (e.g., PDF export).

## 4. Children's Privacy
Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
